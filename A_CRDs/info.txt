data is copied from /srv/nasac.unige.ch/funpopgen/data/unige/funpopgen/grey2/SYSCID/BLUEPRINT_DATA/CRD/THREE_CELL_TYPES/CLOMICS/EGAD00001002672_CLOMICS_v3.0 and then we take the merged_residuals.bed.gz  and merged_residuals.bed.gz.tbi file and copy it there.
When we look at these repositories, it is with all the samples.
to know how many samples we have we do zcat merged_residuals.bed.gz | head -1 | wc -w and we get the number of samples from the header + 6

for sample size comparison, look into the folder /srv/nasac.unige.ch/funpopgen/data/unige/funpopgen/grey2/SYSCID/BLUEPRINT_DATA/CRD/94SAMPLES/CLOMICS

to see if CRD overlap look into /srv/nasac.unige.ch/funpopgen/data/unige/funpopgen/grey2/SYSCID/BLUEPRINT_DATA/CRD/THREE_CELL_TYPES/CLOMICS/CELL_TYPE_COMPARISON_CRD_ANNOTATION

_94s means we are taking 94 samples for each cell type to have consistent comparison
